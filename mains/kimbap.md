Take a lot of rice.
Kimbap fillings.
For your kimbap fillings, you'll want color variation and a fun combo of 5 or so ingredients. Popular choices include Spam, imitation crab, cheese, spicy tuna, spinach, carrots, burdock root, eggs, and a pickled daikon radish known as danmuji. For me, danmuji is a non-negotiable component in kimbap because of its vibrant daisy-yellow color and its sweet-salty crunch!

And start rolling a kimbap!
