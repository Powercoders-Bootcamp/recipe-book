# Ukrainian Borscht Recipe


## Ingredients

- **1 lb** (450g) beef with bone, cut into cubes
- **1** large onion, diced
- **2** medium carrots, grated
- **3-4** medium potatoes, cubed
- **1/4** small cabbage head, shredded
- **2-3** medium beets, grated
- **2** garlic cloves, minced
- **2 tablespoons** tomato paste
- **1 tablespoon** sugar
- **2 tablespoons** apple cider vinegar
- **2** bay leaves
- **3-4** black peppercorns
- **Salt** to taste
- **8 cups** (about 2 liters) water
- **Fresh dill and parsley** for garnish
- **Sour cream** for serving


## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Broth:**
   - In a large pot, cover the beef with cold water and bring to a boil. Skim
     off any foam, add a whole onion, bay leaves, and peppercorns. Reduce heat
     and simmer for about 1-1.5 hours until the meat is tender.

2. **Prepare the Vegetables:**
   - While the broth is simmering, prepare the vegetables. Peel and grate the
     beets, carrots, and dice the onion.

3. **Cook the Beets:**
   - In a separate pan, sauté grated beets with a bit of oil, tomato paste,
     sugar, and vinegar for about 5-7 minutes. This helps preserve the beet
     color and adds a slight tang to the soup.

4. **Start the Soup:**
   - Remove the meat from the broth, strain the broth, and return it to the
     pot. Bring it back to a boil.

5. **Add Vegetables:**
   - Add diced potatoes to the broth and cook for about 5 minutes.
   - Add shredded cabbage and cook for another 5-7 minutes.
   - Add sautéed beets, grated carrots, and diced onion. Simmer for 10 minutes.

6. **Final Touches:**
   - Return the meat to the pot.
   - Add minced garlic, salt, and pepper to taste.
   - Simmer for another 5 minutes.

7. **Serve:**
   - Let the borscht stand for about 15 minutes before serving.
   - Serve hot, garnished with fresh dill and parsley, and a dollop of sour
     cream on top.
   - Optionally, serve with a slice of rye bread or pampushky (Ukrainian garlic
     bread).

Note: Traditional Ukrainian borscht often tastes even better the next day, as the flavors have time to meld together.
